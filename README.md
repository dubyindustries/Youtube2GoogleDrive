# Youtube2GoogleDrive
Code that uploads local files to Youtube and Google Drive Simultaneously

Works by using the Google Cloud console to upload local files into your own google drive and youtube channel.
Setup is a little advanced as it's early stages in the application.

-Must setup your own Google Cloud Console application and enable Youtube Data API & Google Drive API.
-Save Client Secret JSON file in same folder as code with name "client_secret"
-Enable your own email as a test user. 
-Fill out file path and video information section in code // ensure video is .mp4 format 
-Allow for authorization as you run the code with your local file

This project is still ongoing, but as I got it to work, I figured I'll put it out there sooner rather than later.
